# Wine-dataset
The file is NumPy dataset project

using Numpy to create some wine Data, hope you dont mind my references to Cliff Richard, it just felet festive to do so.

The Jupyter notebook should be run in Jupyter notebook to enable the HTML created images (I couldnt get the images to sit side by side in Python)

The cells should be run sequentially down the page until finally a Numpy generated 'wine cellar' is produced in the final data frame.

Enjoy.
